<h1 class="about-ceo">About CEO</h1>
<p>My name is Heather Osterhaus, and to talk about me weâ€™ll have to start with my roots. My grandfather is from Togiak Alaska, his family are from the Aleutian tribe. My father was born and raised there for the first 18 years of his life and then moved to Phoenix, AZ where he then met my mother, making me a descendent of the Aleutian tribe. 

    My desire is to help make the process of selling to tribes for the supply companies as simple as possible. Being able to connect, a need with a service. As well as, helping the tribes receive all the materials they need to help grow their businesses abundantly, and serve each distribution company to meet their quota to purchase from woman owned, minority owned companies.</p>
